# Todo-list---Jake
First project - Jake's Todo list

Followed a walkthrough on Youtube, I might add more functionality to it as I get more proficient at using Javascript.

First attempt at CSS, was pretty intuitive and fun to use, really makes a difference to the overall look and feel of the Todo list.
