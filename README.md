# Todo-list---Jake
**Version 1.0.0**

Code and documents for the creation of a Todo list.

the main motivator for this project was to give me confidence in my ability to write code and follow instructions rather than recreate the wheel of what a 'todo list' is. Instead I went through how another programmer would go about creating this from scratch. In order to complete this project I used HTML, Javascript and CSS.
