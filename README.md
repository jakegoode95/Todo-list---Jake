# Todo-list

**Version 1.0.0**

Code and documents for the creation of a Todo list.

the main motivator for this project was to give me confidence in my ability to write code and follow instructions rather than recreate the wheel of what a 'todo list' is. Instead I went through how another programmer would go about creating this from scratch. In order to complete this project I used HTML, Javascript and CSS.

the Todo list is relatively simple, When you complete a 'todo' you can tick it off by clicking the tick icon and it will put a line through it and increase the opactity so that is less visible. When you want to delete a 'todo' you click on the trash can icon and it will disappear and do a 180 degree spin as it disappears over 0.3 seconds.

In addition, a drop down list was included so that you can cycle through 'All', 'Completed' and 'Uncompleted'. I decided to include this as if you had lots of 'todos' it would clutter the screen and by doing it this way the user would be able to clearly see what is and isn't complete.

Lastly, the more complex part for me to understand, was utilising local storage so that if the user refreshed the page they would keep the 'todos' they had written. The 'todos' will only dissappear if they are removed by the User. This wasn't neccessary but i felt the inclusion of this made it more useful incase the browser freezes and there's a log of 'todos'.
